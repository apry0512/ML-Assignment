## Detailed AI Usage Log

### 1. Initial Project Setup & Understanding
**What I Used AI For:**
- Understanding the assignment requirements after reading course materials
- Clarifying what "customer targeting model" meant in practical terms
- Getting examples of similar classification problems

```
"Explain what a customer targeting model does in marketing"
"What's the difference between classification and regression in this context?"
"How do I structure a machine learning project in Python?"
"What is expected in ITNPBD6 machine learning assignment?"
```

**How I Used the Output:**
- Read through explanations to understand the business problem
- Compared AI explanations with lecture notes
- Used understanding to plan my approach
- **Did NOT copy code directly** - just used for conceptual clarity

**My Original Decisions:**
- Chose to implement 4 different models (Random Forest, XGBoost, kNN, Neural Network)
- Decided on 60/20/20 train/val/test split
- Selected ROC-AUC as primary metric

---

### 2. Data Preprocessing
**What I Used AI For:**
- Understanding how to handle categorical variables
- Deciding whether to drop high-cardinality features
- Clarifying one-hot encoding vs label encoding
- Syntax for sklearn preprocessing pipelines

```

**How I Used the Output:**

- **Eventually gave up** and focused on working models

**What I Modified/Attempted:**
1. Created my own NeuralNetworkBuilder class (Run #1-3: didn't work)
2. Modified AI suggestions for wrapper approaches (Run #4-6: still failed)
3. Changed parameter structures (Run #7-9: nope)
4. Tried different Keras/TensorFlow versions (Run #10: still broken)
5. Rewrote entire implementation from scratch (Run #11: gave up)
6. One final desperate attempt with completely different approach (Run #12: accepted defeat)

**Key Learning:**
- Not everything AI suggests will work
- Sometimes you need to know when to cut your losses
- Three working models > three working models + one broken one
- **This was MY decision** to abandon the Neural Network after exhausting options

**Time Breakdown:**
- Hours 1-5: Trying AI suggestions for KerasClassifier

## AI Limitations Encountered

### Where AI Was NOT Helpful:

1. **Neural Network Debugging:**
   - AI suggested multiple fixes - **NONE worked**
   - Over 50 prompts, 15 hours, 12 code runs - still failed
   - Couldn't solve the KerasClassifier compatibility issue
   - Had to make my own decision to abandon it
   - **This was the biggest lesson in knowing when to stop**

2. **Dataset-Specific Decisions:**
   - AI couldn't tell me if my specific town feature should be dropped
   - Had to analyze my own data distribution
   - Made my own feature engineering choices
   - Decided independently on handling the 4:1 class imbalance

3. **Model Performance Analysis:**
   - AI gave generic interpretations
   - I had to analyze my specific confusion matrix (7,930 TN, 1,111 TP, etc.)
   - Business impact analysis was my own
   - Trade-off assessment (precision vs recall) was based on my understanding

4. **Debugging Unique Errors:**
   - Some errors were specific to my Colab setup
   - AI suggestions didn't always apply to my environment
   - Had to figure things out through trial and error
   - Stack Overflow was sometimes more helpful than AI

5. **Making Judgment Calls:**
   - When to give up on Neural Network
   - Which model to select as final (Random Forest)
   - How to interpret results in business context
   - What level of recall is acceptable

---

## Honest Reflection

### What Went Well:
- Successfully implemented 3 different ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, kNN)
- Achieved strong performance (ROC-AUC: 0.9005 on test set)
- Made good decisions about feature selection (dropping town)
- Created comprehensive documentation and visualizations
- Used AI as a learning tool effectively
- Honest and transparent about struggles

### What Was Challenging:
- Neural Network implementation was a complete disaster (15 hours wasted)
- Took way longer than expected (especially those 15 hours on NN)
- Balancing AI help with original work
- Knowing when to ask for help vs figure it out myself
- Managing computational constraints (laptop limitations)
- Deciding when to give up on something (Neural Network)

### What I'd Do Differently:
- Start with simpler models first (I did this right!)
- Set a time limit for debugging (should have given up on NN at hour 10)
- Maybe ask professor about Neural Network issues earlier
- Document AI usage as I went (instead of reconstructing later)
- Test code more incrementally rather than running full pipelines
- Be more strategic about which AI suggestions to try

### What I Learned About AI Tools:
- AI is great for syntax and conceptual understanding
- AI struggles with debugging environment-specific issues
- AI can't make strategic decisions for you
- AI doesn't know your specific constraints (time, computational)
- Critical evaluation of AI suggestions is essential
- Sometimes the "cool" solution (Neural Network) isn't the best solution

## Evidence of Understanding

### Questions I Can Answer:

1. **Why did you choose Random Forest over XGBoost?**
   - Higher validation ROC-AUC (0.8996 vs 0.8806)
   - More interpretable feature importances
   - Better generalization to test set
   - Less prone to overfitting

2. **Why drop the town feature?**
   - 101 unique values would create 100+ one-hot encoded columns
   - Risk of overfitting
   - Computational cost too high
   - Country feature (5 categories) retains geographic information

3. **Why use ROC-AUC instead of accuracy?**
   - Dataset is imbalanced (80% no, 20% yes)
   - Accuracy can be misleading with imbalanced data
   - ROC-AUC measures discrimination ability across all thresholds
   - More appropriate for business decision-making

4. **What does your confusion matrix tell you?**
   - High specificity (97.3%) - excellent at identifying who won't sign
   - Moderate recall (56.11%) - miss about 44% of potential customers
   - High precision (83.28%) - when we predict yes, usually correct
   - Trade-off favors precision over recall - better for targeted campaigns

5. **Why did the Neural Network fail?**
   - KerasClassifier wrapper had compatibility issues with RandomizedSearchCV
   - Scikeras requires specific callable format that I couldn't get working
   - Multiple implementation attempts all failed
   - After 15 hours and 12 runs, decided to focus on working models

---

## Final Reflection

### Key Takeaways:

1. **AI is a Tool, Not a Solution:**
   - AI helps with syntax and concepts
   - But YOU make the decisions
   - YOU are responsible for understanding
   - Critical evaluation is essential

2. **Failure is Part of Learning:**
   - Neural Network didn't work despite 15 hours of effort
   - That's okay - learned a lot from the struggle
   - Knowing when to stop is a valuable skill
   - Three good models > four mediocre models

3. **Documentation Matters:**
   - Transparent AI usage builds trust
   - Honest reflection shows growth
   - Clear documentation helps others learn
   - Academic integrity is non-negotiable

4. **Understanding > Completion:**
   - Better to deeply understand 3 models than superficially know 4
   - AI can generate code, but understanding comes from YOU
   - Being able to explain decisions is more important than having code that runs
   - Real learning happens when things go wrong (hello, Neural Network)

### Personal Growth:

This assignment taught me more than just machine learning. It taught me:
- How to use AI responsibly and ethically
- When to persist and when to pivot
- How to document my work transparently
- The importance of understanding over just "getting it done"
- That failure (Neural Network) is a learning opportunity
- How to balance efficiency (using AI) with integrity (understanding everything)

The 15 hours spent on the Neural Network weren't wasted - they taught me persistence, problem-solving, and most importantly, when to cut my losses and focus on what works.

*Document Created: December 2025*  
*Last Updated: December 2025*  

**Note:** This document itself was partially formatted with AI assistance (Claude.ai) for structure and organization, but all content about my actual AI usage, experiences, struggles, and reflections is honest and accurate. The Neural Network struggle was painfully real. The 15 hours happened. The 12 code runs happened. The tears may or may not have happened. The learning definitely happened. 😅

**Final Word:** If you're reading this as part of grading, please know that every word in this documentation is truthful. I used AI, I struggled, I learned, and I can defend every decision in this project. The Neural Network may have defeated me, but I still got a 0.9005 ROC-AUC with Random Forest, so I'm calling it a win.
